# pMix - Faust Nodes

A collection of Faust .dsp files to be used with pMix. 

Currently these should be placed in ~/Library/Application Support/pMix2/FaustNodes

## Notes:

at the moment pMix compiles all .dsps in the above folder on load, so you may not want to put all of the files there just yet.
